# Context

Zillow's Economic Research Team collects, cleans and publishes housing and economic data from a variety of public and proprietary sources. Public property record data filed with local municipalities -- including deeds, property facts, parcel information and transactional histories -- forms the backbone of our data products, and is fleshed out with proprietary data derived from property listings and user behavior on Zillow.
The large majority of Zillow's aggregated housing market and economic data is made available for free download at zillow.com/data.

##Variable Availability: 

**Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI):** A smoothed seasonally adjusted measure of the median estimated home value across a given region and housing type. A dollar denominated alternative to repeat-sales indices. Find a more detailed methodology here: http://www.zillow.com/research/zhvi-methodology-6032/

**Zillow Rent Index (ZRI):** A smoothed seasonally adjusted measure of the median estimated market rate rent across a given region and housing type. A dollar denominated alternative to repeat-rent indices. Find a more detailed methodology here: http://www.zillow.com/research/zillow-rent-index-methodology-2393/

**For-Sale Listing/Inventory Metrics:** Zillow provides many variables capturing current and historical for-sale listings availability, generally from 2012 to current. These variables include median list prices and inventory counts, both by various property types. Variables capturing for-sale market competitiveness including share of listings with a price cut, median price cut size, age of inventory, and the days a listing spend on Zillow before the sale is final.

**Home Sales Metrics:** Zillow provides data on sold homes including median sale price by various housing types, sale counts (methodology here: http://www.zillow.com/research/home-sales-methodology-7733/), and a normalized view of sale volume referred to as turnover. The prevalence of foreclosures is also provided as ratio of the housing stock and the share of all sales in which the home was previously foreclosed upon.

**For-Rent Listing Metrics:** Zillow provides median rents prices and median rent price per square foot by property type and bedroom count.

##Housing type definitions:

**All Homes:** Zillow defines all homes as single-family, condominium and co-operative homes with a county record. Unless specified, all series cover this segment of the housing stock.

**Condo/Co-op:** Condominium and co-operative homes.

**Multifamily 5+ units:** Units in buildings with 5 or more housing units, that are not a condominiums or co-ops.

**Duplex/Triplex:** Housing units in buildings with 2 or 3 housing units.

**Tiers:** By metro, we determine price tier cutoffs that divide the all homes housing stock into thirds using the full distribution of estimated home values. We then estimate real estate metrics within the property sets, Bottom, Middle, and Top, defined by these cutoffs. When reported at the national level, all Bottom Tier homes defined at the metro level are pooled together to form the national bottom tier. The same holds for Middle and Top Tier homes.

##Regional Availability:

Zillow metrics are reported for common US geographies including Nation, State, Metro (2013 Census Defined CBSAs), County, City, ZIP code, and Neighborhood.

It's provide a crosswalk between colloquial Zillow region names and federally defined region names and linking variables such as County FIPS codes and CBSA codes. Cities and Neighborhoods do not match standard jurisdictional boundaries. Zillow city boundaries reflect mailing address conventions and so are often visually similar to collections of ZIP codes. Zillow neighborhood boundaries can be found here.

**Suppression Rules:** To ensure reliability of reported values the Zillow Economic Research team applies suppression rules triggered by low sample sizes and excessive volatility. These rules are customized to the metric and region type and explain most missingness found in the provided datasets.
