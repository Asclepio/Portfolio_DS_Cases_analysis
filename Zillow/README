Context
Zillow's Economic Research Team collects, cleans and publishes housing and economic data from a variety of public and proprietary sources. Public property record data filed with local municipalities -- including deeds, property facts, parcel information and transactional histories -- forms the backbone of our data products, and is fleshed out with proprietary data derived from property listings and user behavior on Zillow.

The large majority of Zillow's aggregated housing market and economic data is made available for free download at zillow.com/data.
